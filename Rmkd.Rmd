## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r reading_gapM}
#read in our cleaned gapminder file
gapM <- read.table(file = "output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE )
```

I read in the data, now I'm going to plot **population** and **life expectancy**

```{r plotting gapminder}
plot(gapM$pop, gapM$lifeExp, main = "Pop_vs_LifeExp", xlab = "population", ylab = "Life Exp" )

```

```{r obtain the aggregate data for life exp and pop}
agg_gap_country <- aggregate(cbind(pop, lifeExp)~country, data = gapM, FUN = mean)
plot(agg_gap_country$pop, agg_gap_country$lifeExp, xlab = "Population", ylab = "lifeExp")
```
